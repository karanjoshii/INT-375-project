# INT-375 Project

## Overview

This repository contains the coursework project for the INT-375 course, focusing on data analysis and problem-solving using Python. The project involves analyzing a dataset to derive meaningful insights and address specific problem statements.

## Repository Contents

- **Dataset.xlsx**: The primary dataset used for analysis.
- **Problem Statement.txt**: A detailed description of the problem addressed in this project.
- **code.py**: The Python script containing the data analysis and solution implementation.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Recommended: Create and activate a virtual environment.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/karanjoshii/INT-375-project.git
   cd INT-375-project
   ```

2. **Install required packages**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *Note: If `requirements.txt` is not present, manually install necessary packages as identified in `code.py`.

3. **Run the analysis script**:

   ```bash
   python code.py
   ```

## Project Structure

- **Data Analysis**: The `code.py` script reads the dataset, performs cleaning, and conducts exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and insights.
- **Problem Solving**: Based on the insights, the script addresses the problem statement outlined in `Problem Statement.txt`, implementing algorithms or models as necessary.
